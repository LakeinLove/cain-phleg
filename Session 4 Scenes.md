_Communication log between Facility 336 Director and Facility 336 Temerity Adviser_

_Temerity Exorcist Combat Analysis Chapter 19 Section 11 Subsection 114 Item 93: (NOT FOR FIELD EXORCIST EYES)_

_Engagements between Exorcists of a similar category rarely follow any predictable paths, as both sides attempt to push themselves further to draw all they can from their Blasphemies; beseeching grace guide their hands. This phenomenon, sadly, has never been reliably reproduced withing training facilities without resorting to unacceptable practices surrounding Exorcist safety._

_Alternatively, engagements between Exorcists of significantly divergent categories have a near guaranteed outcome: Utter and overwhelming victory for the superior Exorcist._

_It is the opinion of Temerity that use of advanced assets such as Category 4 and higher Exorcists for training serves little to no purpose._

_"See Victor? These training exercises are pointless, they will not help the Exorcists to grow. Only field work truly provides the risks they need to become useful tools. I cannot understand why you waste your time and valuable resources with these things."_

_"Yours, Alex"_

_Letter from Temerity Hierophant Alexandria Kestral to Castle Facility 336 Director Victor Roschenko_

_"Listen to me you sanctimonious (Expletive Redacted): I don't give a (Expletive Redacted) what you think you know about (Expletive Redacted) combat training. There is no substitute for experiencing the gap between yourself and someone far beyond your own ability. My job is to turn these (Expletive Redacted) (Expletive Redacted) into tools of salvation. Until Temerity pulls it's (Expletive Phrase Redacted) and gets proper field commentary from the assets on the frontline then it will be my pleasure to tell you and your many self-righteous (Multiple Expletive Paragraphs Redacted)._

_"As always, it is a pleasure to communicate like this. Warmest regards, Vic"_

# Meeting Bernie
## Notes:
### Bernie knowledge she will share:
- Alejando's death
- Her and Will's dating history
- William's dismissiveness of their relationship (doesn't know he was jealous of the time Bernie and Alejandro spent together)
- William's cubbie location
- Venla's sabotaging of the ship

## Bernie on Alejandro's Death
### Information
- Came down from upper decks to help Bernie with the stage
- Was planning on going to help Will with some of the plumbing, and brought some of the equipment Will left upstairs
- Planned to drop those tools off for Will at the maintenance tool storage and get the second wood-care kit at the same time to come back and help bernie
- When he didn't come back, bernie went and found him. 
- She goes quiet
- After a moment discusses how she ran and how she'd never seen anything like that. Ran to maintenance breakroom and called the thing in to Venla. Gathered all the staff there and hopes that it keeps them safe.
- She is terrified Will is in danger, but can't muster the courage to go and see.
- Her hands shake, she's clearly terrified.
- Admonishes herself for always being a coward, who has always run away from danger
- She could barely make herself go to the breakroom, she just wanted to run and run and never stop. When she works her brain stops, so she just ran here and went back to fixing the stage.

## Bernie and Will
### Information
- Her and Will dated for almost 5 years
- Explains her love for him, and how having special people in your life can make life so much better
- Discusses their gradually increasing workload, both of them barely having enough time to spend together
- She found out "about Venla" 3 months ago and has been trying to get Will to leave with her.
- Finally, 1 week ago, she told Will everything and he just shut down
- She watched the light go out in his eyes
- He just left, telling her it doesn't matter anymore
- She didn't have the courage to follow him and forcefully change his mind
- They haven't really spoken since, he's avoided her and has been just quietly doing his job
- She barely knows how to hold herself together, and is herself working nearly 80 hours a week.
- She is managing all the staff for him now, he barely speaks to anyone.
- He doesn't really like jewellery but after he just walked away from her she heard from other staff that he's wearing some kind of bracelet
- He's "always loved insects" especially the creepy ones
-
