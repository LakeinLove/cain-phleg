- William's on-again off-again partner
- Hard worker, always out on jobs
- Worked here for 6 years
- Wants to leave, with William, to start their own business doing business cleaning
- Called Bernie
- 6'1
- black, muscular, built, with a hard-labourer's body
- She believes Will just doesn't love her anymore, and they have drifted apart over the last 3 months, despite working close together
- She doesn't know what's wrong with him

## Motivations
- Keep the ship running, and guests happy
- Looking after the maintenance crew

## Information for Players
- Will is in Fluid Processing
- Venla is the boss
- She knows her way around the ship
- William's Quarters location
- Not sure if her and Will are even a thing anymore, and knows he's doing poorly

## Timeline
### Intro
- Her and William split up the hardest jobs for the evening, him taking the fluid duct and her the ballroom stage fix and other small jobs
- She was told about Alejandro (that it was an accident), and not wanting to put more pressure on William didn't go to see him because the radios do not work on the fluid deck.
- She gathered the staff after some small jobs for a little remembrance in the maintenance breakroom
- After 30 minutes, getting everyone set up, she went back out to do the ballroom job to keep Venla off her ass and to let the other workers have some time
### Pressure 0 - 1
- Is in Ballroom
- Knows about Alejandro, thinks it was an accident
- Knows Will's location
- Knows his Room location and lock-pin, wont say without convincing
- Is Will's current partner, but doesn't know where they stand when they're so busy and he never talks about anything

### Pressure 2
- Barricaded doors against infected outside
- Gathering protections for people inside including weapons like hammers and poles
- Called maintenance staff to her, they all arrived at pressure 2. One of them is wounded and she bandages them

### Pressure 3
- Scratched by infected crew at this time
- Moves all people from here to dining hall, as it is the emergency meeting spot
- Begin infection track

### Pressure 4
- With lockdown on the ship in place, moving from each section requires unsealing and resealing the bulkheads, she becomes too tired to do it
- Gets others to move on without her

### Pressure 5
- Succumbs to her wounds if nothing is done
