## Visual Design

Massive, hulking centipede made of chitinous piping and tubes, an amalgam of machine and insect, pumping neon-purple venom from it's undulating core around it's body and leaking from all places

It is the manifestation of everything William fears about the ship, and all he hates about it too

## Introduction

_Phlegethon_\
_The burning river of hell_\
_A never-ending rip of oil alight with flames that burn with such purity that the oil itself is nothing but a memory. The fire that curls around the underworld in spiral coils isn't present here, but instead its precursor. The oil that births a never-ending gout of flame. Sickly, light-drinking black poison that flows inexorably into every vein, every crevice. Within the slick, purple ribbons of light coil and crack like lightning through the night sky; frozen and turned to liquid power._

_This accursed fuel pumps through a mass as much living as dead, insectoid and mechanical, nothing so merciful as fire perpetuated by this sickening black ooze. It curls in a mass of limbs and pipes, a segmented body made of steel and chitin bound together in an unholy matrimony._

_The limbs that thrust their way out of each segment are uneven, with three or four joints and dripping in oil. Each straight cut of leg is different. Metal. Infected Flesh. Oil-slick Bone. Chitin. They are misshapen, irregular, and twitch at an unnerving speed._

_The figure itself is obvious, a centipede of impossible proportion, with only some of the monstrosity revealed it takes up the entirety of the generous corridors you have found it in. It curls and cascades throughout the space, looping over itself, shifting and adjusting in place to better situate its mass. And sitting at the end of the last segment is a face: rictus howl etched in lacquer as oil disgorges from its mouth and eyes, like so many other jointed sections._

_You realise, to your horror, there are actually eyes behind the oil. Pupils. The flowing black pus not simply being ejected through holes where eyes should be, but instead pouring from glands acting in parody of human form. They stare with an inhuman hatred, something so utterly pure that the purple glow they emit feels almost unimportant._

_At the centre of the beast, 20-30 massive segments down from the face you will see in every dream, a pulsating, irradiated core of molten heat and purple corruption thumps rhythmically like a drum made from translucent human skin. With each bass-y palpitation the core glows and dims, shooting veins of purple light through the rest of the creature._

_The most horrific thing about this visage that accosts you, is that it sees you and it KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE. There is intelligence behind its eyes, seeping through in drips alongside the torrent of enmity. It knows you. It sees you. This monstrosity recognises what you are, its mouth changing, its teeth crashing, grinding, and cracking as its lips curl and oil oozes through every gap in every tooth. It knows you. And in this moment, as the tortured scream on its face contorts into a gleeful smile, you recognise what it is too. You see it. You know it._

_This is Phlegethon, the unholy oil of endless flame._

_This, is SIN._
