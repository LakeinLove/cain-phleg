# Session 4:
## Must:
- Bernie Confronts players, is sceptical but warm to the maintenance players
- Venla and 6 Security Officers enter ballroom quietly on their way to the corridor where the players were before
- Bernie notices and recoils upon noticing Venla, trying to avoid being seen, gets the players to hide too
- Bernie notices weapons when they huddle into the corner, questions the players with a serious tone
- Bernie does believe they are hunters, because she knows every single staff member on the ship, checks and does all roster changes
- Knows they cannot be on the ship, so they got here somehow
- Explains what she found with Alejandro, is terrified for Will but can't make herself go, afraid what she'll find
- She explains Venla stuff
- Doesn't know why Will is acting the way he is
- Shuddering explosion ripples the floor and shakes the entire ship
- All walkie-talkies immediately go dead, timeout-beep
- People in the crowd start panicking, they were already scared from the big waves
- Safe-zone gathering alarms play
- After 2 minutes normal people begin streaming into the registered safe-zones
- 4 minutes after explosion Vikram, Dipesh, and only 2 other maintenance staff come running in flanked by 2 guards, Vikram is badly wounded and they all look rough
- Explain they were attacked and barely fought their way out of the breakroom to make a run for it
- Ran past Venla and her guards, they were headed for the engine room with weapons drawn, 6 more guards had joined them for a total of 12
- 4 of the new lot started fighting the monsters
- 2 of them ran the maintenance folk away
- Venla and crew kept going to engine room, took 2 of the maintenance members Alex and Marley, the best at engine repairs who isn't a main engineer
- Said there was some kind of danger in the engine room and one of the engineers was injured, probably more monsters
- Engine room is deck 2 central
- But more importantly, something massive was following them
- Parker screamed and when silent as a massive wall of something they couldn't quite see hit him like a freight train as they were running
- They could barely make out muted sobbing and a sickening cackling laugh
- The explosion came from below, sounded to Vikram like one of the engines busting its housing and potentially blowing a gasket
- Bernie resolves to go save Will, he can't be left alone in Fluid Maintenance, but she is also probably needed in the engine room
- Bernie tells them about Will's secret room on deck 4, says he made that place a little haven
- The entrance to the ballroom explodes open with splinters, revealing 10 or so infected
- Players see something massive undulating behind the creatures in the darkened corrider (lights seem to be out aside from floor lighting)
- It moves and then all goes still
- FLASHBACK WEAPONS LOCKER SCENE
- Players fight to defend the civilians and hold them off, Bernie helps
- Time is not on their side, Bernie sees their skill and asks them to rescue Will, begs
- If he was in fluid processing when the explosion went off, he might be still trying to get out
- His secret spot is only slightly out of the way
- She agrees, sprints off through some shortcuts to get to Engine room quickly
- As they run, a presence begins to weigh on them seconds before Phlegethon coils itself around the corner to the entrance of the cubbie
- Session Ends
