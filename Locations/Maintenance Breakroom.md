SF8 - Section F, Floor 8, Starboard

# Introduction
_The first thing you hear upon cracking the door is jovial music, an upbeat pop song that is saccharine sweet with a relaxed male vocalist singing over it. Soft voices are talking beneath the din of the music, but their words are too faint to hear. The smells are next, the unmistakable smell of grilling meats and spicy food, mixed with a slightly less pleasant smell of sweat and exertion. Finally, as the door is fully opened, you see a group of workers half-in overalls, the tops shrugged off and the fronts unzipped to reveal the undershirts beneath. They all have drinks, save for 2, and while some are straining themselves to smile, most look absolutely dead to the world. They all have the puffy red eyes of people who have cried recently. The conversation grinds to a halt as they notice the door open, and an extremely tall Indian man walks towards you with a kind smile. "Ah, sorry this is a staff area. Can I help you?"_

## Characters
### Vikram
- Vikram is kind, a bit slow, and knows his way around the wiring of panels on the ship.
- Vikram is in his early 40s, very tall, and slender. From India, has a strong accent and speaks many languages.
- He is quiet under pressure, but always tries to make the best of any situation.
- He knows his way around the ship, and is always happy to be of help.

### Dipesh
- Dipesh is a young and inexperienced maintenance crew member, almost always follows William or Bernadette around to back them up.
- He's American and only 26 years old, short and quite dumpy.

### Marley
- 56 year old Finnish sailor by background, Marley is a hard working woman.
- Surly and rakish, she is always looking for an edge and is a bit of a grump most of the time. She always has a smoke if you want one, and will lend an ear if you want to complain.
- She jumps back and forth between the engineering section and the maintenance section, as she's done just about everything on a ship.

# What happened
- After Bernie found Alejandro, she called Venla and reported it, gave her statement to security, and was instructed to get William and have them all wait together in the break room.
- Venla doesn't understand the sheer point-of-breaking the ship is under, and Bernie gathered them all in the break room. 
- William was apparently still busy in the boiler works, Bernie said she would check on him, and then Bernie went to work in the Ballroom despite everyone in maintenance begging her to stay.
- William cannot be contacted because radios never work in the boiler section, something about fluid processing messes with them.
- She's just like that, William too.
- Will is barely around these days, because of just how many hours he is working, and it means as the 2IC Bernie has to rally the troops often.
- Bernie set the crew up in the break room and told them to take out the snacks that Alejandro normally provides, to play some of his music and to send him off. She'll be back with Will after she fixes some wood in the ballroom.
## When asked
- "She must have asked for Alejandro's help with the wood in the music pit, he's the best when it comes to finishing and making things presentable."
- William's been in the boiler room for at least 4 hours at this point, but it takes hours to get anything done in there because of the heat, the difficulty to get deeper in the bowels, and the complexity of the repair. Not to mention the state of the ship.
- Bernie and Will were lovers, but they were always quietly supporting one another. 2 weeks ago 3 members of maintenance were fired and since then Will has barely been around and Bernie is always doing the people management.
- Dipesh worked with Will 3 days ago and said he was lifeless, like there was nothing left in the tank. Julietta (other staff member) chastises him and says he should show some respect. Dipesh says that Will needs a break, so does Bernie, or they're gonna snap.
- Will and Bernie were heard having a shouting match by Vikram, with Bernie begging Will to go somewhere with her. Will just told her it was pointless, and that he needed to get back to work.
