## Archival Analysis 11489-C-112-1

_Archival Hierophant Emanuel Belial Recording. This is Archival Analysis 11489-C-112-1, selected for review by Archival Personnel as is standard for every CAIN investigation at standard interval 112._

We see a dark, candle-lit cathedral ceiling, depicting angels and demons slaying one another in vicious conflict. Stacks of parchment rise up to the sky on tables of rich mahogany and oak. The walls are lined with book shelves covered in dust, ancient tomes containing scriptures and doctrines central to CAIN's orthodoxy.

Carrying censors billowing pungent smoke, and wearing full-body robes that flow elegantly are 5 individuals. The lead, decorated in filigree and finery denoting their higher status is speaking into a physical tape recorder.

_As this investigation was marked to feature intense strain suffered by Exorcists of Repentia Unit 2655-X, it has been selected for Supplicant Initiation to Archival Duty. With me, *cough*, and I expect each of them to confirm their identity with a simple "here", I have Supplicant Ramiel, Supplicant Haniel, Supplicant Micah, and Supplicant First Grade Evangeline._

_We will be performing the Rite of Metasubstantiation, in order to review the facts of the case as recorded, with the Supplicants performing trans-internalisation for each of the Exorcists and the Hierophant sustaining the Rite.

I expect, as this is your Initiation, you will be less than professional, and though I will not tolerate any shennanigans I will allow for a level of informality in our proceedings. You have all, I assume, read the dossier for your Exorcist and have become familiar with their basic histories and behavioural idiosyncrasies. They will not prepare you, no matter what you have been told by your educators. You will lose yourself to their minds and to the time-frame itself. Do not worry, I will be here to stabilise you all, and to allow a safe return. You will be experiencing what they experienced, and seeing things as they truly were. This will allow us to ensure that the record is correct and accurate, and to amend any discrepancies and search for any cases of... Exorcist Operational Discretion_

_For each of you, quickly name your Exorcist and confirm their basic details. We do NOT need flowery details, as all you Supplicants are so eager to provide. Names and details only. We will start with Supplicant First Grade Evangeline, as she is apparently the best among your lot._

Players introduce characters basically in flavour of CAIN acolytes, as written in their Dossier.

_Very well, excessive details not withstanding that was an acceptable level of accuracy. Perhaps it might even lessen your post-Rite despondency. We shall begin the Rite now, gather you hands upon the Scripture, and we shall begin._

_A cold spike moves itself instantly through your hands, shooting up your arms and embedding itself in your SIN SEED as your thoughts are distorted and become..._
