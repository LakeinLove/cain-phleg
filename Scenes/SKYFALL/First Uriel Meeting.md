## In Ballroom

_As you're acclimatising to the room, a small person walks up to you. They're... You know what they're like but... But it's like every time your eyes look at them the thought slips from your head. You realise, for a moment, who you are. Your body speaks for you, and seems to have no problem with looking at or processing this THING you're about to speak with._

_A jovial voice rings out, lilting and feminine, but every word is like grinding static to understand. They're just talking to you about nothing, looking at the four of you and asking about cosplay or something. The words are agony to think and slip from your thoughts without your consent. The only thing you can focus on are those eyes. Those glowing, golden-yellow eyes, staring from that pitch-black static of their body. It's like they can see YOU. The real you, watching this here in the Archive._

_Your body says something in turn, some small deflection that pacifies them, but nothing you can recall. You try to focus on them to clear some of the static, but it's not good. You're already turning away, looking for Bernie in the back, and like that the abomination in front of you simply slips away; your eyes drawn to their true goal._
