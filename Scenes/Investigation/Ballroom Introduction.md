_You all enter the ballroom through a pair of double-doors and are greeted with soft jazz being played by a small quartet on the stage. The ceiling is low, a soft wooden finish on all surfaces with some gold metallic highlights on tables and corners of the bar. The lighting is warm and slightly dimmed, and the centre of the room is clear of the tables that lined the outside to allow dancers a clear space to strut their stuff. You can see the curtains drawn slightly on the right of the stage, stage right that is, and you know from your gathered intel that Bernadette is up there just behind it._
