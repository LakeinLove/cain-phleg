_The corridor outside is a mess, thick black oil smeared around the entrance and along some of the walls. Multiple sets of footprints are preserved in the oil too. Before you can even approach the room, there are sounds from within, the snapping of a camera, the flash of photography, and the muffled muttering and shuffling of people within. There are thin plastic ribbons, some kind of quarantine tape, wrapped across either side of the corridor around the door at waist height. The smell of oil permeates the air even this far away, but to some ephemeral sense your grace grants you tinges it with another smell. Something acrid, the smell of acid and smoke, and worse: a pervasive feeling of utter disgust._

When the room is empty:

_The first thing that comes to mind is the call from the ship to the mainland. Venla Mikkelson telling the others that it is likely just an accident. There is no accident in the world that could cause damage like this. The body of Alejandro is not recognisable from the photo attached to your dossier. His body is lying face down, and is covered from head to toe in that same black oil, pools of blood swirling within and along it. His back is torn open, the maintenance overalls he was wearing ripped open, and the flesh of his back is gouged out in rough chunks. You think, for a second, you catch a glimpse of his sternum. His whole body is covered in these wounds, like something ate from him._

(To Shadow Players: Your shadow whispers to you: "Smug Satisfaction. This is a work of Pride.")

_The room itself is mostly untouched, save for the oil that spattered and leaked from Alejandro himself. Whatever this is, it happened in the hallway before he made it inside, and he was left in this state to die. His tools are splayed out on the floor, the box he was holding dropped at the entrance and clearly scattered. The corpse is still fresh, rot has not set in, but it can't be long before his body begins the slow decay._

_You notice, most prominently, that there is another set of footprints, and some hand-prints on the walls that seem to circle around the body._

Info they can get:

- The handprints are larger than Alejandro's small hands
- The footprints are congruent with someone running
- There are small dents in the floor and some of the walls, like punctures about 2 fingers thick that didn't fully pierce the metal
- Alejandro had a toolbox for wood maintenance, but was also carrying some tools for pipe repair and pressure sealant that wouldn't be in a wood-based toolkit.
- Alejandro's lanyard, lying on the floor, says he is an upper-decks worker. Why would he be at this location when his job is mostly repair and touching up of guest-facing locations.
- If they question the forensic team, they will learn Bernadette ran away to tell someone, and has been instructed to remain in the break room with everyone else.
- All maintenance staff are to be in the break room until further notice.

# AS THEY LEAVE
_Walking out, you start heading for the (WHATEVER) and Mitch you notice something. It's like a... No, it's not anything. There's just something niggling in the back of your mind. It takes almost a minute of walking until you realise what it is: There is a soft clicking noise coming from somewhere every so often. It's almost silent, it's infrequent, but... there it is again! More clicking, this time from another direction. You barely notice it but with your heightened mind the difference between calm and on-edge is that much more noticeable for you. As you go to say something, it abruptly stops. You wait another 20-30 seconds of walking but it doesn't start up again. Was this in your mind? You are walking next to Takeda, you think about telling him, and for a moment your mind remembers..._
