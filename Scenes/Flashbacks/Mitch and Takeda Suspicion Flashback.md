- From Mitch's perspective

Mitch, we're gonna have a conversation that will determine how you feel about Takeda.

_You stand across from Takeda, hands moving back and forth in formations taught to you by the Palace trainers. It has been almost an hour going back and forth between your two powersets. Takeda has been forming cages of force the entire time, mastering more and more complex uses of his powers in an attempt to gain the BLASPHEMY. You haven't managed a single thing, not even a whiff of power. No energy or even sensation of whatever this stupid skill set is. You think you're done with whatever this waste of time is, but as your mind wanders to thinking "this guy is probably sick of having me waste his time" you instantly feel a sensation of space itself warping and suddenly you and Takeda are standing withing your palace._

Mitch, describe the location you're in, and then I want the two of you to roleplay this first use of Palace. Thoughts are softer here, you might say words but what comes out of your mouths is the honest truth, even if you yourself don't know the meaning.

Takeda, I want you to, without meaning, spill some of your secrets. You will think you're just talking amiably, and you can tell us what you try to say and then tell us what Mitch hears. Takeda does not remember saying the truth, only what he tries to say.

Mitch, I want you to talk back and convey the thoughts in return. You don't have this disconnect and can speak freely, but you feel far more emotionally connected to Takeda and want to speak truthfully.

## Roleplay Happens

_The room returns, but it's slower than it started. Mitch you feel the world fade, and Takeda you feel the sensation of comfort end as you are both deposited back into the real world. Only about 30 seconds have passed, but you're surrounded by 3 exorcists in their trench coats, standing 2-3 meters away from you. They're not actively doing anything or even speaking, but they stand there relaxed in case anything happens. Violence coiled like a snake._

- Takeda, what did you get out of this? What was conveyed to you.
- Mitch, how do you feel about Takeda now?

Return to the present, and Mitch I want you to decide if this experience made you trust Takeda more or less, and if you listen to that experience as you decide to tell him about the noise you think you heard or not.
