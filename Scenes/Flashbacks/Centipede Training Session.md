Training Director Cassidy, instructing the initiates in the way to hunt and fight a Centipede.

---

_An imposing woman wearing rugged military gear marches across the front of a small concrete room with around 20 initiates sitting inside. Her outfit is as much armour as it is formal uniform, a thick flack jacket tailored to fit beneath a large cloak she wears adorned with CASTLE filigree and no small number of medals. The cloak sits on her shoulders, the sleeves dangling to her side as her arms are bare; covered in scars, and bound with the kind of muscle only attained after decades of tireless use. Each initiate in the room is bludgeoned into listening to her voice as it reverberates harshly off the concrete walls._

_"Centipedes are ruthless, efficient machines of mass death. They do not have obtuse goals like other sins. Their only goal is to kill everyone and everything around them; usually to make their host watch. A Centipede is not intelligent enough to talk, usually, and has a single-minded devotion to the slaughter of all in its range."_

_She shrugs off her cloak and turns to the side to show the back of her left bicep, which has the telltale markings of burns and acid covering it. The arm is missing a chunk from the centre of the scar tissue._

_"Do not let this make you believe you will easily outwit one. They are cruel and cunning beyond what they seem. Their instincts are second to none, and the speed with which they will happily delegate tasks to their infected swarm leaves them as the undisputed killer of Exorcists. Fighting the hoard is a waste of time, they will not stop coming and if you bog yourself down searching for them, you will never manage to complete your goals. Kill them swiftly and move on. More Exorcists have died from fighting these creatures than any other SIN. And now, I'm going to tell you how to kill them before they kill you."_

_She details physical weak-points of previous Centipedes, their tendency to coo towards their hosts with sadistic mirth, and the way they cleverly use the terrain to their advantage by manipulating it with their venom and the legions the create._

_"You will, if you are lucky, never encounter one of these; you will make it to retirement age before you are forced to face one. In the event that you are, you MUST hurry in your hunt for the Domain and the 3 trauma questions. Do not fight a Centipede without answering at least one question, it is suicide more than any other SIN."_

1. What are you trying to escape?
2. What do you hate the most about humanity?
3. What do you truly regret?

_After hours of detailed study and training administering the antivenom, you are let go. Each of you return to your dorms to recuperate and to absorb the lessons Cassidy gave to you._
