## Wake-up Call
Select one player, they will be the POV for this first section. Ask them to describe their dream, the imagery they are swimming in when separated from consciousness.

_A sharp, intense siren tears through your mind and rends asunder all the immaterial realities you held within, pulling you like a screaming baby into the cold of the real world. The siren stops abruptly, and a voice through a tinny intercom comes through: "Exorcist blank, get dressed and be ready in 5 minutes. Failure to comply will result in discipline."_

_The voice clicks off after a moment of static, and the realities of your current situation assail you. You are in pitch darkness, the inky black an uncomfortable blindfold as you feel that wherever you are is softly vibrating. Your hand shoots out instinctively to where you remember the light switch from the few moments before you fell asleep. As your fingers slide over the cool metal surface, you find a switch and with a fairly firm depression the light snaps on, filling the tiny box you appear to be in with a dispassionate sterility only matched by the inhuman design of your temporary quarters._

Time to describe the interior of the box that each player is in.

_CASTLE TRANSPORT DOCTRINE dictates that transportation to and from CASTLE TRAINING FACILITIES for all Exorcists of Category 2 or less is to be conducted via REDACTED, with individual Exorcists isolated and contained for their own safety. The hermetically-sealed rooms must contain the following amenities and comforts._

- _One (1) washbasin and tap, no less than 11 inches in diameter and with a strong flow of potable water_
- _One (1) rest alcove, no greater than 5cm longer nor less then 3cm shorter than the body height of the Exorcist_
- _One (1) standard issue mattress, adhering to CASTLE MATTRESS REGULATION 1872 SECTION 3 SUBSECTION L specifications_
- _Two (2) points of illumination, both of which must be controlled via One (1) switch located within 63cm of the rest alcove_
- _CASTLE STANDARD air filtration system_
- _Monitoring suite to ensure safety and chastity of Exorcists during their transit_
- _Three (3) nutritional supplements in the form of CASTLE HAPPY EXORCIST COMMUNION WAFER FLAVOUR HUNGER REPELLENTS_

The player must describe in a few words how they get changed into their uniform that they had removed the night before.

If asked how they fell asleep, tell them they remember being ushered into the box by staff, and given 5 minutes of "preparation time" before lights out. It's been a while.

After the 5 minute timer, the door hisses and slides open, revealing a massive hangar inside which a helicopter of a design the characters have never seen is being prepared and boarded by multiple people in heavy armour. The hangar is dimly lit, save for spotlights from nearly every direction lighting the helicopter and a circle around 5 meters larger in diameter than it's longest point.

Looking to their left, they see one of the other players. Ask that player to describe their look and demeanour to the table and the have them describe how they feel. Proceed down the line.

After the final player is introduced, now describe the woman standing before them:

_In a suit so immaculately tailored you can only assume it must be refit daily, a blond woman with a high-and-tight haircut and a glistening scar down her left cheek stands at parade rest holding a thin folder in one hand. When you all stumble to your positions, marked handily by 4 small Xs in front of your containers, she begins to speak_

_"Exorcists of Repentia Unit 2655-X, you are about to be wielded by CAIN for the only purpose which you serve: to Wipe Away the Stain. You shall let your bodies be tools for this glorious purpose, honing your minds to fulfilling the task set before you to your upmost ability. This is a special mission, as you have all been deemed worthy to receive additional education in the nature of CAIN's ideals and goals. You will be boarding the vessel behind me, and you will be delivered directly to the location of the SIN as detected by SEER. You will take this dossier-" She lifts the folder in her hard and takes a few steps forward before handing it to (player number 3 in order). She returns to her position and continues. "- and conduct your own debriefing aboard the transport vessel. You are advised to work together, and you will cleanse the world of this stain. Upon successful return, your status as Repentia Exorcists will be rescinded, and you will be granted the full privileges of being an Exorcist. Board the vessel, and good luck."_

_She nods, turning and walking off into the darker sections of the hangar bay until you can no longer see her._

Describe the players walking together, slowly making their way to the helicopter which is still being packed.

When they approach, they will be instructed to board and to wear special headphones that are interlinked. The massively armed soldiers continue to work, but within 2-3 minutes after settling in the characters are sealed in as the doors close and people within begin shouting orders. The space they are in is tightly enclosed and pitch black, nothing can be seen outside it, and even the whirr of the engine cannot be heard. The only indicator they take off is a sudden lurching and sinking feeling in their stomachs.

Let them now do their player briefing, by giving them CAIN DOSSIER S-C775, and clarifying any questions they might have that they reasonably would know.
