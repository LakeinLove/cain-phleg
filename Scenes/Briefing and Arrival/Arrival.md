## Quick points
- Describe landing
- Heavily Storming
- Main deck is abandoned, doors to inside are shuttered, can hear voices and din of conversation from behind the doors to the banquet hall
- One of the side vendors' security blinds are damaged, meaning Exocists can sneak in
- Lights on the deck are still on, but only the sailing lights
- Most objects are locked down, some loose debris flying around as the ship sways intensely with the waves
